# ENTRANCE EVALUATION PROJECT

A program that analyzes the stored data of the park in a strange order by sorting it using a heap sort algorithm. There are 2 ticket counters in the park, left and right, at which groups can purchase tickets. Groups arriving will always enter the line with the fewest people. This way it helps the park to complete all ticket transactions in the fastest way possible using Circular Linked List and Queue (FIFO Data Structure).
